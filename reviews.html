				<p>World famous Chef and TV star Gordon Ramsay visited our establishment not too recently and he had this to say:</p>
				<p>"When I first came to this establishment I thought I was in for it...thank f***k I was wrong because this restaurant should be your number 1 choice if you're within 500 miles of it."</p>
				<p>Gordon is of course famous for his angry personality and ruthlessness in the kitchen on television shows such as Kitchen Nightmares and Hell's Kitchen.</p>
				<p>Our staff were stressed when they heard he was visiting but through our expertise we impressed Chef Ramsay and secured his positive review.</p>
